      <h2>Legacy of Laglag Bala</h2>
      <p>The group was formed in hopes of being seen during the time when Airports in the Philippines were implanting "tanim bala" or "planted bullet" to passengers whether foreign or local people. It got to the point that we had to name our group as to have awareness of what's happening in the Philippines.</p>
